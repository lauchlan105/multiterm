# multiterm
This project is still in its infancy and development is currently on hold.
The MultiTerm project is intended to allow multiple programs of any kind to be run as sub-processes of a
single program.

The intended purpose is to equip each program with its own IO stream and allow programs to relay information between one-another, all bundled in a robust terminal-based interface complete with a tabular layout, independant stream
scrolling and event based menus.
